<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">Many
people who are led up with living in overcrowded and polluted cities
dream of moving to the country and having their own small farm, or
smallholding*. The Telegraph newspaper published a report about
families who had attempted to make that dream come true. One couple,
Ed and Sally Budd, bought a small farm a few months ago. It consisted
of a house in need of some repair and a plot of land. Ed and Sally
are planning to restore the house and they have already begun growing
vegetables. They've also got a few cows and sheep. Both Ed and Sally
work in London and only visit their smallholding at weekends.
Fortunately, a local farmer looks after their animals during the week
in return for keeping his own animals on their land. </SPAN></FONT></FONT>

course, some people are very enthusiastic at the beginning, but they
soon start making mistakes. The Telegraph describes the experience of
two people, Liz Sharkland and Gerry Toms, who had a rather bad start.
&quot;We began in completely the wrong way,&quot; says Liz. &quot;We
saw an advertisement in the paper for this beautiful old farmhouse.
We came up to see it and loved it immediately. It was July and the
weather was very hot. We bought the place and moved in late autumn.
Then it began to rain.&quot; The fields turned into mud and Liz and
Gerry found that it was not suitable for keeping animals. Gradually,
however, Liz and Gerry started to make progress. They learned a lot
from simply living on the smallholding. Then Liz attended a
smallholding course and studied for a Higher National Diploma in
countryside management. Liz has now gained enough experience to be
able to offer expert advice to other people who want to start a
smallholding. </SPAN></FONT></FONT>

sports people are under a lot of pressure to win. They also
experience powerful emotions. When they win or do well, they feel
excited and extremely happy. But when things go badly, they feel
depressed and anxious. This is why athletes have to be mentally
strong. In the past, athletes only trained to get physically fit.
Today, professional sportsmen learn to control their mind too.
England rugby player Johnny Wilkinson played brilliantly at the Rugby
World Cup in 2003. But after that things started to go wrong. He was
injured a lot and he wasn't playing so well. He told The Times: &quot;I
couldn't control my emotions. Things were going wrong and I couldn't
do anything about the situation. The problem was that I couldn't
control my mind. If I wanted to feel better, I knew I had to learn
how to control it.&quot; </SPAN></FONT></FONT>

you'll buy tons of unnecessary food. If you really have to take
children with you, agree in advance what one thing you'll buy them
and don't change your mind later, when they get tired or excited.
And, above all, limit the time spent in shops to an absolute minimum;
don't treat shopping as a leisure-time activity. Do we have any
chance in the battle against the powerful advertising machine? I
doubt it. Most of us like spending time in supermarkets, even if we

There is a strong desire to give the child what he or she wants. But
according to the report, this is the wrong thing to do. The problem
is that children will grow up believing that they can have everything
they want immediately. This can lead to serious problems because they
never learn to plan for the future and think in the long term. When
they are adults, they may buy too many things because they can't
control how much money they spend. They may have poor health because
they only cat or drink what they like instead of what is healthy. </SPAN></FONT></FONT>

story began like this. At 9.45 pm on December 3rd 1926, Agatha
Christie left her home in the south of England, saying that she was
going out for a drive in her car. The next morning, her car was found
quite far away crashed. The front end of the car was in some bushes,
the headlights were still on. Inside, there were only some women's
clothes and Agatha Christie's driving license. </SPAN></FONT></FONT>

modern city life becomes too stressing, many people who live in the
city feel like moving out to the countryside. The countryside appears
to offer so much: clean air, beautiful scenery, less crime, a slower
kind of life, and the chance to 'get back to nature'. In the country
you can save money when you grow your own fruit and vegetables. For
young children, the countryside can be a very exciting place to grow
up. You can explore and play outside in reasonable safety. However,
there is also a price to pay if you want to give up city life for the
beauties of the countryside. </SPAN></FONT></FONT>

country life is not always so idyllic. Teenagers often find the
countryside boring and depressing because there is little or no
exciting entertainment. Services and basic conveniences in small
towns and villages are not as good as those in the city. The lack of
public transport means that parents sometimes have to take their
children up to 30 miles to go to school. People have less choice
about where to go shopping and there is a lack of basic
entertainment. This may explain why more teenagers feel unhappy in
country areas. Also villagers often dislike the so-called 'townies'.
They think that people from the cities do not really understand the
true spirit of the countryside. They try to stop farmers go shooting.
They do not use local village shops, they have little contact with
the local people at all. </SPAN></FONT></FONT>

people have an idea of what is right and what is wrong, and why
things are the way they are, and who they are and who to trust.
Philosophers want to know the truth about life for themselves and
spend their time studying, thinking and asking questions. The first
western philosophers lived in Greece. They encouraged people to find
their own answers to questions about life instead of believing the
Gods did everything. Socrates was the most famous of these. He is one
of the most famous philosophers in the world, yet he said: &quot;One
thing I know and that is that I know nothing.&quot; This is why he
never wrote or lectured. He only discussed. He did not believe he
could tell anybody anything, that it was better to encourage
individual thinking. </SPAN></FONT></FONT>

philosophers are still encouraging people to think. Schools in some
countries teach philosophy to children. Reading books written by old
philosophers can be difficult because the language is from the past.
So stories are used to help schoolchildren make their own decisions
about what is right and wrong and think about the best way to solve
problems. Why do we need philosophy? There are plenty of people who
think that killing animals is cruel, but eating animals is fine. If
you are one of these people, you should ask yourself why. Why is
killing animals cruel? Why is it okay to eat animals? You might find
that the answer to each question is very different and you could have
an argument by yourself using your own ideas! Go on and argue — you
will understand. You will begin to understand the subject more
deeply. And this helps you to feel comfortable with it. When we ask
ourselves questions, we start to understand ourselves and our lives,
and it's up to us to make changes or not. If the ideas in your head
agree, this means you have integrity*. What you say and what you do
arc the same. Everyone respects someone who has integrity! </SPAN></FONT></FONT>

fine — you don't have to add any polite words. However, when I took
Alexander home to meet my parents in the UK, I had to give him an

I said, &quot;Mmm... delicious.&quot; In Russia people are much more
direct. The first time Alexander's mother came to our house for
dinner in Moscow, she told me that my soup needed some flavouring.
After that when we argued about it my husband said, &quot;Do you
prefer your guest to lie?&quot; Alexander complained that in England
he felt like a 'village idiot', because in Russia if you smile all
the time people think that you are mad. In fact, this is exactly what
my husband's friends thought of me the first time I went to Russia
because I smiled at everyone, and translated every 'please' and
'thank you' from English into Russian. At home we now have an
agreement, if we are speaking Russian, we can say &quot;Pour me some
tea&quot;, and make just a noise like a grunt when I get it to him.

grandmother moved into an old people's home when she was 80 and I
visited her there when I was in Britain. She was sitting in the
living room with about fifteen other residents, mostly women, half of
them asleep. The room was clean and warm and the care assistants were
kind and cheerful. 'The News' was on the television, and the only
other sound was snoring*. People only moved when they needed to be
helped to the bathroom. It was depressing. I wanted to leave. So when
I came across a newspaper article about a new type of old people's
homes in France, I felt happy. The idea is simple, but revolutionary:
combining a residential home for the elderly with a nursery school in
the same building. The children and the residents eat lunch together
and share activities such as music, painting, gardening and caring
for the pets. In the afternoons, the old people enjoy reading or
telling stories to the children and, if a child is feeling sad or
tired, there is always a kind adult to talk and help. There are trips
out and birthday parties too. </SPAN></FONT></FONT>

advantages are enormous for everyone concerned. The children are
happy because they get a lot more individual attention and respond

they see illness and death and learn to accept them. The residents
are happy because they feel useful and needed. They are more active
and more interested in life when the children are around and they
take more interest in their appearance too. And the staff are happy
because they sec an improvement in the physical and psychological
health of the residents and have an army of assistants to help with
the children. If older people can understand and accept the youth of
today, and vice versa, there will be less conflict in a community. In
a world where the number of old people is increasing, we need as much
understanding and tolerance as possible. </SPAN></FONT></FONT>

school in Derbyshire in northern England was really proud of its
project. The course lasted a total of six weeks. In this time, the
children learned about growing vegetables and healthy living. They
also learned how to make supports in wood for climbing plants like
beans and peas. They helped to plant vegetables and take care of
their vegetable gardens. It helped the children understand more about
where food comes from and it also brought different people together.
In another project in Wales schoolchildren grew their own vegetables
without the use of dangerous chemicals and they learned about the
problems caused by intensive farming. As a result, the children began
eating a lot more fresh fruit and vegetables instead of crisps and
chocolate. The head teacher says that this has contributed to the
children's health and it has also resulted in less rubbish in the

grow on their plot of land. Then they compared their result with the

studied how happy and negative moods affect people's lives. Professor
Forgas has found that people in a negative mood know more about the

Genetically modified food plants are less damaged by diseases and can
better survive in bad weather conditions than natural food plants. As
a result, harvests are higher and so food costs less to produce. This
is an advantage for both consumers and producers. The biggest worry
is the possible danger of GM food for people's health. When
scientists put a new gene inside a plant, that gene changes the plant
in some desirable way. For example, the fruit stays fresh for longer.

think that no amount of testing will ever be enough. Dr Doug Parr,

helpful because it gives you ideas on how to improve your posture,
body language and gestures. If you're allowed to use notes or a plan

50 % of people in the United States say that they are shy. And for
more than 13 % of Americans, being shy is a serious problem. The
situation in other countries around the world is very similar. Of
course it is normal to feel a little shy sometimes. Most people feel
shy in a new social situation, for example when they start a new job
or have to meet and talk to strangers. But in these cases the shyness
usually passes quickly. </SPAN></FONT></FONT>

people, however, are extremely shy. They are so shy that they cannot
live normally. They feel worried, they sweat and tremble when they
are with other people. In order to avoid these unpleasant feelings,
the shy person avoids* other people. Shy people often say to
themselves: &quot;I'm not normal. People think I am boring and
unattractive. I'm a failure.&quot; These negative thoughts make it
more difficult for the shy person to make friends. The result is that
the shy person is lonely and sad. </SPAN></FONT></FONT>

going to talk to at least one stranger today&quot; or &quot;I'm going
to ask X to come for a coffee with me.&quot; When you achieve your
target, you will feel very satisfied. If you are shy, you should try
to walk with your head up so that you look at other people's faces.
Soon, walking like that will become a habit and you will feel better

&quot;Interview all your family members before it is too late,&quot;
says Julie Mason. &quot;Make a basic family tree of your close family
and step by step make it bigger. Of course, it is not easy to have
accurate information from relatives about things that happened in the

different versions of the same events. It is very important to check
everything.&quot; </SPAN></FONT></FONT>

records in local libraries and in national archives are also
important to the family historian. Old newspaper reports are often
kept on in local libraries. Sometimes, researching your family
history can be lonely work. Remember that you can find a lot of help
on the internet. Of course, it is not easy to trace your family
history a long way back and you must be very patient. Believe me, in

you for recording it. </SPAN></FONT></FONT>

years ago Mr Cobbe went to a Shakespeare exhibition and saw a
painting of Shakespeare called the Janssen portrait. He was amazed by
how similar it was to the painting owned by his family. He took his
painting to a Shakespeare expert. Since then it has been dated and
X-rayed. They now believe it was painted in 1610, when Shakespeare
was 46 years old — six years before he died. Mr Cobbe thinks he

have often dreamed of going to exotic faraway places that I have only

Sahara Desert in Northern Africa. In this excellent book the author,
Catherine Guigon, describes the desert in such vivid detail that I

while looking at my photo album! Of course, I wake up when I realise
I only wish I could take pictures that well! </SPAN></FONT></FONT>

book takes the reader through a journey across the vast Sahara
Desert. It took the photographer more than four years and 25 trips to
Africa to collect all the photographs to show the beauty of the
largest desert in the world. I found this book incredibly
informative. As soon as you open up the first pages you not only read
about the physical facts of the desert, but also the social and
environmental aspects as well. For example, did you know only a
quarter of the desert is covered in shifting sands? I spent a lot of
time just enjoying the pictures in the book, before I would read a

in Africa that I had never even heard of and all of them have unique
cultures, languages, art, and history. I've learned that the Sahara
Desert is 40 times as large as the UK! The author also puts a lot of
effort into describing the living aspects of the desert. She covers
the plant and animal life. As well as describing the Sahara Desert of
today, the book also goes deep into the history of Africa, which some
refer to as the 'birthplace of mankind'. Ancient civilisations and
their remains are spread throughout the desert, especially along the
famous River Nile. Did you know the Sahara Desert was once a green
land filled with greenery? Now that I have this book I cannot imagine
not having it! Sahara is a very detailed and fascinating book. </SPAN></FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">People
often ask which language is the most difficult to learn, and it is
not easy to answer because there are many factors to take into
consideration. A native speaker of Spanish, for example, will find
Portuguese much easier to learn than a native speaker of Chinese
because Portuguese is very similar to Spanish, while Chinese is very
different. The greater the differences between the second language
and our first one, the harder it will be for most people to learn.
Many people answer that Chinese is the hardest language to learn
possibly influenced by the thought of learning the Chinese writing
system. The pronunciation of Chinese appears to be very difficult for
many foreign learners, too. However, for Japanese speakers, who
already use Chinese characters in their own language, learning this
language will be less difficult than for speakers of languages using
the Roman alphabet. </SPAN></FONT></FONT>

 <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">Some
people seem to learn languages readily, while others find it very
difficult. Teachers and the circumstances in which the language is
learned also play an important role, as well as each learner's
motivation for learning. If people learn a language because they need
to use it professionally, they often learn it faster than people
studying a language that has no direct use in their day-to-day life.
British diplomats and other embassy staff have found that the second
hardest language is Japanese, which will probably come as no surprise
to many. But the language that they have found to be the most
problematic is Hungarian, which has 35 grammatical cases. </SPAN></FONT></FONT>

there is such a nation as Belarus, then there should be purely
Belarusian family names. In the mid-20th century, academician Nikolay
Birillo began searching for Belarusian family names. Family names
ending with 'vich', such as Mitskevich or 'sky', such as Ivanovsky
denote nobility. Scientists say that names ending with 'vich'
appeared in the 15th century while those with 'sky' date back to the
17th century. Meanwhile, names ending with 'ov' — such as Ivanov —
only appeared in the 19th century; they are similar to those met in
Russia and Ukraine. Belarusian names have unique national features,
being formed from the name of professions, animals and plants:
Gonchar (potter), Kravets (tailor), Zhaba (frog). Later, these simple
names were supplemented with specific endings — depending on the
locality: 'eiko' (Domeiko), 'ushko' (Adamushko), 'ik' (Davydik), as a
result, more complicated family names appeared. </SPAN></FONT></FONT>

was just finishing the final details for the surprise party she was
planning for her husband. She had been thoroughly preparing for this
event, designing every aspect of the party from the invitations to
the food, and she was very excited about it. Family members whom
Andrew hadn't seen in years were flying in from Poland in a few days.
Liz had tracked down several college friends, and they were coming
from various places across the country. A band and dancers were
invited. </SPAN></FONT></FONT>

about the party. She could not wait to see the look on his face when

party was supposed to be on Saturday. As Liz was daydreaming about
picking relatives up at the airport the next day and taking them to
their hotel, Andrew walked into the kitchen and said, quite
certainly, &quot;Sweetheart, I don't want anything special done for
my birthday.&quot; &quot;What do you mean?&quot; Liz responded
calmly, though her heart began to beat. &quot;I mean that I don't
want a surprise party.&quot; &quot;Okay,&quot; Liz said. &quot;Not a
problem.&quot; Liz's mind raced. There was nothing she could do about
Andrew's request now. And, frankly, she didn't want to. Liz had been
planning this for more than a year. The party would go off as she
intended. She did not want all of her effort to fail. When Andrew
came home Saturday evening from playing soccer with friends, he was
shocked. Tears filled his eyes. This response was something Liz had
not predicted. Among the crowd he saw friends whom he had not seen in
nearly 20 years and family members who had come from Poland just for
this evening. But along with being deeply moved, he was also angry
with his wife. He knew he could be emotional, and he did not like
people to see him that way. That was why he did not like being
surprised. </SPAN></FONT></FONT>
