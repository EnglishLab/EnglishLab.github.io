don’t use harsh words with them which may hurt. It’s important to

Why are there many one-parent families? How does the state help such
families? It’s sad that families are getting smaller these days.
One-parent families are those where one of the parents is no longer
part of the family unit. Of course such families have support on
behalf of the state. There are special financial programs to help the
families with low income. Children may have free meals at school or
they may have an opportunity to go to a summer camp.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

Are there any things that you do with your parents together? It’s a
pity, but my parents and I are usually very busy during the weekdays
and we seldom have a chance to spend time together. Sunday is the day
when we can sit at a table and talk over everything that happened
during the week. Eating together makes us feel close and we often
have our most frank conversations at these times. </SPAN></FONT></FONT>

What can you advise a person who wants to have a close and happy
family? First of all I can advise for anyone to try to understand the
feelings of your parents and show respect to them. Even if you don’t
agree with their thinking, try to make them understand politely,
don’t use harsh words with them which may hurt. It’s important to
celebrate your parents’ and grandparents’ birthdays. It will make
them realize that you care for them.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

Nowadays an average family has one child. From your point of view,
how many children should there be in the family? It’s sad that
families are getting smaller these days. I think it’s so great to
have a sister or a brother. To my mind there should be two or three
children in a family. You will never feel lonely in a big family.
These are people who are committed to one another.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

They say: &quot;A person has just one true friend”. What do you
think about this? In the reality there are very few true friends. A

not always fully pleasant. True friends are hard to find, and are
worth holding on to. They are worth more than gold.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

Let’s talk about education. What can you tell me about the system
of education in Belarus? Each citizen of the Republic of Belarus is
guaranteed the right to get education. The multilevel system
established in the country allows exercising the right to the full
extent. Education in Belarus is free and compulsory from age 6 to 15
and the system is well administered. The majority of girls and boys
come to school for the first time when they are 6 years old. The
first four years of school are devoted to acquiring basic skills and
habits of writing, reading, count; mastering primary knowledge of the
nature, society and man; getting acquainted with principles of
personal hygiene and healthy way of life. Thereafter pupils go on to
basic secondary school for 5 years culminating in a certificate of
basic education at age 15. The curriculum continues to be
academically based and universal across the state. </SPAN></FONT></FONT>

Let’s talk about different types of houses. Tell me about the
house/flat you live in. We have a nice flat in a new block of flats.
Our flat is on the fourth floor. It has all modern conveniences:
central heating, gas, electricity, cold and hot running water, a lift
and a chute to carry rubbish down. There are three rooms, a kitchen,
a bathroom and a hall in our flat. The living-room is the largest and
most comfortable room in the flat. In the middle of the room we have
a square-table with six chairs round it. To the right of the
dinner-table there is a wall-unit which has several sections: a
sideboard, a wardrobe and some shelves. Between the two large windows
there is a little table with a colour TV set on it. A small round
table, a sofa and a standard lamp are in the left-hand corner. </SPAN></FONT></FONT>

There are many types of housing: detached houses, semi-detached

cottages and bungalows. A flat or an apartment is a part of a larger

Your friend doesn’t know what to choose: to live in a city or in
the country. Give him/her some advice. Living in the countryside has
a lot of advantages. As the advantage we can consider the fact that
the country is less polluted and the traffic isn't so heavy. In the
countryside the air and water are so clean. There aren't any huge
blocks of flats, modern skyscrapers or bothersome traffic jams. You
can enjoy walking in the forest and picking mushrooms or hunting. </SPAN></FONT></FONT>

like to live near a forest. I'm a good swimmer, so I'd like to have a

Now let’s talk about food. What do people eat in Britain?
Traditional British cuisine includes fish and chips, roast beef,
steak, mash, and probably famous pudding. Certainly we may find
different kinds of food in any restaurant in England, but these are
the popular I guess because many Englishmen, answering the question
about their gastronomy stereotype, will name these things.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

real British cuisine distinguishes itself either due to its high
quality and high prices, or is not so expensive if you are satisfied
with Bangers &amp; Mash. A lot of bistros, snack bars, and even pubs
provide us with sandwiches as well as dishes of the European cuisine.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

where the traditions of them are combined with modern - the British
cuisine nowadays. The day starts with affordable lunch in the best
restaurants. You may have a snack in Fast Food Shops, where you will
find pizza and hamburgers and it is also available in some small
fast-food bars. If you have a wish, you may make a culinary voyage in
London. Indian cuisine, Chinese cuisine, American cuisine, and even
African cuisine are represented in the restaurants of London.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

have a snack at midday just to keep you going on. That’s why we

to serve chops and watery mashed potatoes every day with a glass of

When we want to buy something, we go to a shop. There are many kinds

and be always in high spirits, as well as build up stamina and get
tempered. The first reason why I collect books is that I am really
keen on reading: Books open to me a whole world of events and people.
The second one is that collecting rare books is getting to know
history better. Reading a book is getting information about the
period it describes, feeling its atmosphere and getting to know
historical figures of the period.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

Let’s talk about healthy way of life. What can you do to become a
healthier person? It is widely known that life expectancy is
increasing. But the reason why the average figures are higher than
they used to be, say, hundred years ago is not that all people live
longer than before. One reason is that, due to medical research, many
illnesses were eliminated; the second one is that fewer people die in
wars. Generally, the life of modern man is endangered by many
factors. One is the increasing pollution of the environment by
industry and transport; another one is sedentary lifestyle of people
living in cities and towns. The third one is the quality of food we
eat and water we drink. The fourth one is that living in big cities
leads to epidemics of many catchy illnesses. </SPAN></FONT></FONT>

Sport has been developing with the developing and growth of the

in our life and day-to-day activities, because its main purpose is to
bring up the harmoniously developed generation of strong and healthy
people. Sport makes our bodies strong, quickens our reaction, and
shapes the wits. It also prevents us from getting too fat, gives us
so valuable practice in making eyes, brain and muscles work together
and makes us more self-organized and better disciplined.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

sickness, attending the body-building trainings will bring you
nothing but harm. And also, going in for sport is always connected
with a great risk, because any athlete can get an injury. But it

day. Even people, who say they don’t care what they wear, choose
clothes every morning that say a lot about them and how they feel

displayed on the catwalk. That kind of clothes is a product of famous

extremely expensive. It is also not designed to be worn every day,

Let’s talk about Britain. What do you know about this country? The
full name of the country is the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland. The United Kingdom is situated on the British
Isles. The British Isles consist of two large islands, Great Britain
and Ireland, and a great number of small islands. Their total area is
over 314 000 sq. km. The British Isles are separated from the
European continent by the North Sea and the English Channel. The
western coast of Great Britain is washed by the Atlantic Ocean and
the Irish Sea. Northern Ireland occupies one third of the island of
Ireland. It borders on the Irish Republic in the south. The island of
Great Britain consists of three main parts: England (the southern and
middle part of the island), Wales (a mountainous peninsula in the
West) and Scotland (the northern part of the island).</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-US">There
are no high mountains in Great Britain. In the north the Cheviots
separate England from Scotland, the Pennines stretch down North
England along its middle, the Cambrian Mountains occupy the greater
part of Wales and the Highlands of Scotland are the tallest of the
British mountains. There is very little flat country except in the
region known as East Anglia. Most of the rivers flow into the North
Sea. The Thames is the deepest and the longest of the British rivers.
Some of the British greatest ports are situated in the estuaries of
the Thames, Mersey, Trent, Clyde and Bristol Avon. Great Britain is
not very rich in mineral resources; it has some deposits of coal and
iron ore and vast deposits of oil and gas that were discovered in the
North Sea.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

Give me a piece of advice on what sights to see in London. London is
one the richest cities in its sights to visit. I strongly recommend
you to visit the Bridge of London, the Houses of Parliament and Big
Ben. You can go to Hyde Park just to rest and see the Poet’s
Corner. But the best look on the city is from London Eye. </SPAN></FONT></FONT>

Do the British differ greatly from Belarusian people in character?
Why? I think, it’s true. We differ a lot because of our different
languages, customs, traditions and historical development. These are
the factors which influence greatly on characters of people.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
